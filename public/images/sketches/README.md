This is the folder where all sketch previews should live in so that they can be correctly rendered in 
`/sketches`.

Currently all files should have the `.png` extension (something I might be able to fix in the future) and the name
of the file should be the same as the name of the sketch in `lib/sketches`, for example:

* Source File - `lib/sketches/new_sketch.js`
* Image File - `public/images/sketches/new_sketch.png`
