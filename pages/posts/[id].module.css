/* I'm not entirely sure why, maybe because we're using Tailwind and Tailwind disable all default styles but, when
* converting Markdown to HTML and trying to render it there were no visible differences between the tags. For example, a
* `<ul>` tag would not render the bullet points. 
* As such, this component-specific CSS file serves the purpose of styling
* the elements in the posts as we can't set `className` for those tags in the Markdown file. 
* Also, we can not simply use `ul`, we have to do something like `.post > ul` otherwise we get an error because the `ul`
* selector is not pure, not 100% sure what this means but it's worth pointing out why this is done this way. */
