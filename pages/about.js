      <p className="py-2">Hi There!</p>
      <p className="py-2">
        My name is Dino and Iâ€™m a Software Engineer based in Lisbon, Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹
      </p>
      <p className="py-2">
        Iâ€™m currently working at{' '}
        <Link href="https://remote.com" className="text-yellow-300">
          Remote
        </Link>
        , but Iâ€™ve previously worked at{' '}
        <Link href="https://onfido.com" className="text-yellow-300">
          Onfido
        </Link>{' '}
        and{' '}
        <Link href="https://unbabel.com" className="text-yellow-300">
          Unbabel
        </Link>
        .
      </p>
      <p className="py-2">
        Although in my past experiences Iâ€™ve mainly worked with Python Iâ€™m now
        heavily invested in using Elixir, which Iâ€™ve been loving so far!
        <br />
        In my free time I do like to mess around with synthesizers and music
        related stuff, I also like to read and to surf when the time allows it.
      </p>
      <p className="py-2">
        Finally, Iâ€™m currently an Elixir mentor at{' '}
        <Link href="https://exercism.org" className="text-blue dark:text-yellow">
          Exercism
        </Link>
        , which does help me to get better at explaining concepts and ideas to
        other people, it also forces me to reinforce some learnings because you
        want to make sure youâ€™re not giving incorrect information to the people
        whose solution youâ€™re reviewing! Overall itâ€™s a very rewarding
        experience!
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-4 block text-xl font-medium">Where to find me</h2>
      <p className="py-2">
        Feel free to find me in any of these platforms!
