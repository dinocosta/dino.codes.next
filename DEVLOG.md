* Picked [Plus Jakarta Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Plus+Jakarta+Sans?query=Jakarta) as the font for the
	website. Since I'm not very good at picking fonts I just read [this
	blogpost](https://www.creativeboom.com/resources/top-40-fonts-in-2023/) and picked the only font that was available in
	[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* Did an initial attemp at the homepage, with links at the bottom-left of the page, but it's proving harder than initial
	though to find the perfect combination of Tailwind classes to achieve this.
* Selected a colorscheme to use and updated the homepage to use these new colors.
